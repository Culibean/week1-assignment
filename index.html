          The Flying Past celebrates the charm and character of vintage air
          travel. We share the stories, style, and atmosphere that made flying
          in earlier decades so memorable. Whether you love classic aircraft,
          old menus, or retro crew uniforms, we’re here to bring the past back
          to life.

        <h3 class="tag">The History of the Jetliner</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The rise of the jetliner transformed air travel from a lengthy journey
          into a fast, modern experience. From the first commercial jets of the
          1950s to the wide-bodied icons of the 1970s, these aircraft reshaped
          global travel and brought the world closer together. This section
          explores how the jet age began, the planes that defined it, and the
          legacy they left in the skies.

        <h3 class="tag">Aviation Style Icons</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Aviation has produced some of the most recognisable uniforms and looks
          in modern history. From tailored jackets and bold colours to sleek
          cabin crew designs of the 1960s and 70s, these styles shaped the image
          of air travel for generations. This section highlights the people and
          outfits that turned flying into a true fashion moment.

        <p>
          Airlines once took great pride in serving elegant drinks high above
          the clouds, offering passengers cocktails that captured the glamour of
          early jet travel. From classic martinis to signature inflight mixes,
          these recipes reflect a time when service felt indulgent and
          unhurried. This section brings those vintage creations back for you to
          enjoy at home.
