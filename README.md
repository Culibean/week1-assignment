#User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
🐿️ As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
🐿️ As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.

🎯 Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
🎯 Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) and background images are correctly implemented with accurate file paths.
