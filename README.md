# Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

- I have added a header, main and footer as well as a nav bar
- I fixed the header so it scrolls down with the user for easy navigation
- The user should be able to navigate easily cross the page
- I have added one main image as the background (Main) that sits behind all sections
- I also added a logo to the page

Things I have found difficult

- I'm not necessarily a designer and I struggle with translating what I have in my head and putting that on the screen/into the design (most things end up looking like Windows 95)

- I sometimes find it hard to use all relevant CSS selectors and I believe I still make my life quite hard and my style sections could be more streamlined

- I also didn't add several images per section as I find this difficult to oversee on one page

- My main errors were with the positioning of the elements and having them stay in the correct spot. MDN has helped massively and general googling the issue (there is always at least one person with the same issue)

- I still need to practice debugging and work on the flow of my HTML to make it cleaner
